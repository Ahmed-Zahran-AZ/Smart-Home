## Description:
This is a smart home prototype with the following features:
- A door lock that opens upon entering the correct PIN
- A temperature sensor that will automatically turn on the AC after a certain temperature
- A torch LDR representing ambient light and an outdoor light with intensity dependent on it by PWM
- An LCD displaying the stats of both the temperature sensor and the torch LDR
- A fan that can be controlled through UART
- 3 Indoor lights (can be controlled through UART) that form 3 levels:
  - 1st is open
  - 1st and 2nd are open
  - 1st,2nd and 3rd are open

## Future Improvements:
- [ ] Setting the password first then saving it to EEPROM (either internal or external)
